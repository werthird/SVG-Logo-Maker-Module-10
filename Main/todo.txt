Needed Downloads:
    - Inquirer
    - Jest

===============================================================

TASK:
  - Make sure that you remove dist from the .gitignore 
    file so that Git will track this folder and include it when you 
    push up to your application's repository.

  - Build a parent Shape class and use inheritance for the other classes to use

  - The application must include Triangle, Circle, and Square classes

  - This application must include Triangle, Circle, and Square tests using Jest 

  - Each shape class should be tested for a render() method that returns a 
    string for the corresponding SVG file with the given shape color.

  - The following example test should pass:
      const shape = new Triangle();
      shape.setColor("blue");
      expect(shape.render()).toEqual('<polygon points="150, 18 244, 182 56, 182" fill="blue" />');

  - You may need to add additional files in the lib folder for handling user input, 
    writing to a file, etc. Writing tests for these additional files is optional.
